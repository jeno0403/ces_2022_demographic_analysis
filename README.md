# The Generational and Demographic Determinants of Voting Behavior: Evidence from the 2022 CES

## Overview

This paper presents the analysis and methodology used to examine voter behavior and preferences in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. The primary objective is to explore the factors influencing political party affiliation and voting patterns, focusing on demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic variables. The study incorporates statistical modeling, data visualization, and a detailed discussion on the relationships between voter characteristics and party alignment. This paper provides all the necessary insights, data, and methodologies to understand the dynamics of voter preferences during the 2022 midterm elections.
